This program plays the game FizzBuzz

## The Rules
FizzBuzz is a game where the player counts to a certain number, but replaces specific numbers with words.  
Every number divisible by 3 is replaced by "Fizz".  
Every number divisibly by 5 is replaced by "Buzz".  
Every number divisibly by 3 AND 5 is replaced by "FizzBuzz".  
So, counting to 15 would look like this:  
1  
2  
FIZZ  
4  
BUZZ  
FIZZ  
7  
8  
FIZZ  
BUZZ  
11  
FIZZ  
13  
14  
FIZZBUZZ

## To Run
There are multiple FizzBuzz programs in this folder. FizzBuzz.java will run in java, but FizzBuzz.s and FizzBuzz.asm must run through QtSpim.  
To set the size of the game (the number the program will run until), set the variable "size" to your specified number.  
It will be near the top of the code in any program.  
The default size is 100.
