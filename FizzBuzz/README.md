This program plays the game FizzBuzz

## The Rules
FizzBuzz is a game where the player counts to a certain number, but replaces specific numbers with words.<br />
Every number divisible by 3 is replaced by "Fizz".<br />
Every number divisibly by 5 is replaced by "Buzz".<br />
Every number divisibly by 3 AND 5 is replaced by "FizzBuzz".<br />
So, counting to 15 would look like this:<br />
1<br />
2<br />
FIZZ<br />
4<br />
BUZZ<br />
FIZZ<br />
7<br />
8<br />
FIZZ<br />
BUZZ<br />
11<br />
FIZZ<br />
13<br />
14<br />
FIZZBUZZ

## The Program
There are multiple FizzBuzz programs in this folder. FizzBuzz.java will run in java, but FizzBuzz.s and FizzBuzz.asm must run through QtSpim.<br />
To set the size of the game (the number the program will run until), set the variable "size" to your specified number.<br />
It will be near the top of the code in any program.<br />
The default size is 100.
